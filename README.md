# Simulation and Optimization of Urban Traffic Congestion

This repository contains the codebase for the ENG-270 – Computational Methods and Tools modeling project at EPFL.
The project implements a discrete-time urban traffic simulation to study congestion formation and compare traffic signal control strategies under increasing demand.

The simulation combines:

C (core simulation engine),

Python (automation, aggregation, and plotting),
and produces all results presented in the accompanying report through a fully reproducible pipeline.

No simulation outputs, figures, or compiled binaries are included in the repository.
All results are generated automatically when running the pipeline.

# System Requirements

The project has been tested on EPFL SIE Ubuntu Linux VDI with the following environment:

Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (EPFL SIE standard image)

# Required system packages

Install the following packages if not already available:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential make gcc python3 python3-venv python3-pip


This installs:

- gcc and make for compiling the C code,
- python3 and pip for the Python pipeline.
- Python Environment Setup (Recommended)

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

From the root of the repository:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

After activation, your prompt should show (venv).

2. Install Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


The main Python dependencies include:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- pyyaml

# Building the C Simulation Engine

The core traffic simulation is implemented in C and must be compiled before running the pipeline.

From the root directory:

make -C src_c

This command compiles the C source files, produces a simulation executable inside src_c/ (or src_c/bin/, depending on the Makefile).

No manual compilation steps are required beyond this command.

# Running the Full Simulation Pipeline

All results presented in the report (tables and figures) are generated automatically using a single command.

From the root of the repository, run:
python -m src_py.pipeline.run_all --config config/base.yaml

This command performs the following steps:

- Loads the simulation configuration from config/base.yaml
- Executes the C simulation for all demand levels and control strategies
- Aggregates raw outputs into summary tables
- Generates all figures used in the report

# Output Files

After successful execution, the following directories are created automatically:

out/
├── figures/       # Generated plots (PNG)
└── summary.csv    # Aggregated performance metrics


These outputs are not version-controlled and should not be committed to GitHub.

# Configuration

Simulation parameters (time step, arrival rates, signal strategies, random seeds, etc.) are defined in:

config/base.yaml

This file can be modified to explore alternative scenarios without changing the source code.

# Reproducibility Notes

The full pipeline is deterministic given a fixed random seed. Running the pipeline multiple times with the same configuration produces identical results.

All figures and tables in the report can be regenerated by executing the pipeline command above on EPFL SIE Ubuntu VDI.

# Troubleshooting

make: command not found

Ensure build-essential is installed:

sudo apt install build-essential

Python module not found

Make sure the virtual environment is activated:

source venv/bin/activate

Permission issues

Ensure execution rights:

chmod +x src_c/*
